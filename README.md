## FreeCodeCamp Front End Project - Use the Twitch JSON API

## User Stories

- [ ] I can see whether freeCodeCamp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- [ ] I can click the status output and be sent directly to the freeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv channel.
- [ ] If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

## Thoughts

The task looked simple enough, so the main problem was to come up with a good design. I can't say that I did a good job, but at least I got to try and make buttons with ripple effect, as well as use that cool sliding underline!
